Introduction

This project seeks to counter a unique cyber attack, known as “Brandjacking”. Brandjacking
refers to the malicious practice of using a well-known brand’s name, logo or other
distinctive elements without authorization to deceive and defraud consumers [1]. This
can involve creating fake websites, social media profiles or advertisements that mimic
the legitimate brand’s appearance. The goal of brandjacking is often to trick customers
into sharing sensitive information, making unauthorized purchases or engaging in other
harmful activities. It undermines consumer trust, damages brand reputation and poses
significant legal and financial risks to the targeted brand.
Preventing and addressing brandjacking requires proactive online brand protection measures
and rapid responses to mitigate its impact. Online brand protection encompasses
a suite of strategies and measures aimed at safeguarding a company’s reputation, intellectual
property and consumer trust in the virtual realm. This project delves into the
pivotal role of online brand protection in mitigating risks, preserving brand integrity
and ensuring sustained growth through an open-source toolkit named “Scamsweep”.
The toolkit is typically used to identify threats to various brands by performing activities
such as: data collection, web-reconnaissance, URL analysis, text analysis, image
processing, social media monitoring, malware reverse engineering, brand risk assessment,
alert creation and taking down the detected Indicators Of Compromise (IOC) pertaining
to the brand being investigated.
