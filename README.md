### **Scamsweep - Open-Source Toolkit for Online Brand Protection**

**Scamsweep** is an open-source project designed to help small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) detect and mitigate threats to their brands in the online world. In an era where the growth of the internet has shifted businesses online—accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic—the risk of brand abuse and counterfeit products has increased significantly. Cybercriminals use various methods, such as copying trademarks, logos, and other intellectual assets, to impersonate reputable brands and sell counterfeit goods. This not only leads to revenue loss but can also damage brand reputation and result in legal consequences.

**Scamsweep** is developed as a cost-effective solution for businesses that cannot afford expensive, commercial tools but need to safeguard their brand value. It leverages open-source intelligence to detect brand abuse and potential threats to the organization’s online presence, allowing businesses to run proof-of-concepts and assess the risks before committing to a commercial solution.

### **Project Motivation**

With the rapid digital transformation, cybercriminals have become increasingly sophisticated in exploiting brand assets for financial gain. These include:

- Impersonating brand names and trademarks
- Misusing logos and keywords
- Selling counterfeit products online

Many organizations are unaware of brand abuse until an unhappy customer notifies them. Current solutions for detecting these issues are often prohibitively expensive for small organizations, leaving them vulnerable. Scamsweep aims to bridge this gap by providing a lightweight, accessible toolkit that assesses online brand protection risks and helps businesses protect their intellectual property.
